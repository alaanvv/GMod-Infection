# Infection

While **infected**, hit the others with a **crowbar** to infect them  

It's my first GMod mod, so, it isn't too much yet  

## Usage

- Place the script in `gmod/lua/autorun` folder

## Commands

- `get_infected`: Infect yourself
- `infect_random`: Infect a random player
- `get_uninfected`: Uninfect yourself
- `purge_infection`: Uninfect everybody
- `infected_players`: Prints all infected players
