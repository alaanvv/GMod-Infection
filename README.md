# Infection

While **infected**, hit the others with a **crowbar** to infect them  

It's my first GMod mod, so, it isn't too much yet  

## Usage

- Place the script in `gmod/lua` folder
- In-game, run `lua_openscript script.lua` on console

## Commands

- `get_infected`: Infect yourself
- `get_uninfected`: Uninfect yourself
- `purge_infection`: Uninfect everybody
- `infected_players`: Prints all infected players

## Add/Fix:

- Effects when taking damage
- Pills addons to remove infection
- Dox IP hihihi
- Add a HUD for the admin to avoid using the console
